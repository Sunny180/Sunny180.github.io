											<h3>the short stories</h3>
											<blockquote>Sitting on his work chair he was smoking his regular gold flake, third in a row when he saw to his horror that the smoke coming out of his cigarette made a sign in the nearby mirror "You will die in 30 minutes".

Terrified, he got a shock and felt a lightening streak of pain in his chest. He wanted to scream but no sound came out from his mouth. He fell down from his chair and started crawling slowly towards his cell phone. He was able to grab it and saw it was 09:33 a.m before he collapsed and all he had before his eyes was layers and layers of infinite dark black.

He woke up petrified and panting from the horrendous dream. He looked into the mirror. Nothing was there. He needed a cigarette to relieve himself of the stress. He went to his study table. Took out a cigarette from his silver case sat on his work chair and was about to light it u with his imported Polish lighter when his phone's message tone rang. He got up and went to see what it was when to his horror he found the time to be 09:03 a.m.

He kept the lighter aside. Took out the packet from his study desk and threw it out of the window. He then took out the packet of Chocolate bar from his fridge. Sat down on his work chair and kept the cylindrical chocolate bar between his fingers and pretended like he was smoking it just like his son used to do looking at him when he was alive.He rested his head on the chair top and started staring at the ceiling fan, with a cold expressionless face waiting for the time to pass.</blockguote>
